            ### ✨ New Features
            *   **App Mode Selection**: Choose between "Online & Offline" or "Only Offline" mode at startup.
            *   **Offline Mode**: Dedicated offline experience with restricted online features and no login requirement.
            *   **Strict Login Enforcement**: Online playback and downloads now strictly require user authentication.
            *   **Forced Update Mechanism**: App checks for critical updates and prompts the user to update.
            *   **Offline Home Banner**: Visual indicator when running in offline mode.
            *   **Smart State Management**: Auto-switch to Online mode on login, and Offline mode on logout.

            ### 🐛 Fixes & Improvements
            *   Refactored `UpdateService` for better maintainability.
            *   Improved startup routing logic.
            *   Fixed login/logout state synchronization.
